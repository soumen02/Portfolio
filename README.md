## Description 
The website is a simple website, hosting the projects from my Comms Labs class. It is created using HTML, CSS and javascript. Various libraries and elements are put to use to make the website as creative, interactive and visually pleasing. 

The website has three main parts: 
- Landing Section
- About Me Section
- Projects Section

The Landing section has a modern look with a particles.js background. This adds a layer of interactivity and lets the user play with the particles. The page reveals my name and my interests in a very simply yet aesthetic manner. There is a typing animation used to describe what I'm into. My LinkedIn and Github pages are also linked to the icons. There is a large logo card to the rigth side of the page. 

The About Me section shows a picture of myself along with a short description. My Email ID is also shown there. 

Lastly, the projects section hosts the 4 main Comms Labs projects. hovering over them shows a description and reveals the website hosting the projects and also the github page hosting the code. 

### Challenges and Future Improvements
- I faced a challenge perfecting the CSS as I felt it was the most complicated part of creating this webpage. I had to heavily rely on W3 Schools and Youtube to get past this.
- Errors with libraries, as I have used a lot of libraries like vannila tile, typed, scroll, jquery, etc. It was a challenge making everything coherent and getting the desired result. 

I would improve this further by including a work experience section, to match my Tech CV.
